Description: PostgreSQL extension that verifies indexes
 This extension verifies the logical consistency of PostgreSQL B-Tree indexes.
 The extension consists of SQL-callable functions.  When no error is raised
 during a call to these verification functions, no logical inconsistency was
 detected.  This is useful as a general smoke test to detect corruption.
